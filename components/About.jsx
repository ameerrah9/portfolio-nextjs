            I creatively develop intuitive software solutions
          </p>
          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            My name is Ghameerah (Juh-meer-ruh) McCullers, and I'm driven by a
            commitment to creating impactful, user-centric solutions. With a
            robust background in software engineering & development, I excel in
            crafting high-quality, performant code. Proficient in JavaScript
            technologies such as React.js and TypeScript for building scalable
            frontend applications, alongside a solid foundation in backend
            development using Python, including expertise in RESTful API
            creation with Flask and Django. Leveraging over 2 years of
            specialized Software development experience, I bring a deep
            understanding of backend technologies, automated testing, and a
            passion for developing scalable, efficient solutions.
          </p>
          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            My background actually begins as a student-athlete. I attended
            Central State University, which happens to be one of the first
            Historically Black Colleges/Universities. I graduated in 2017 with
            Cum Laude honors and won a Women‚Äôs basketball championship. I then
            started my career as a cook and manager at Waffle House & after two
            years, I decided to transition into tech!
